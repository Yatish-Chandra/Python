Qr Code generator Module
================================

The pyqrcode module is a QR code generator that is simple to use and written
in pure python. The module can automates most of the building process for
creating QR codes. Most codes can be created using only two lines of code!

Unlike other generators, all of the helpers can be controlled manually. You are
free to set any or all of the properties of your QR code.
